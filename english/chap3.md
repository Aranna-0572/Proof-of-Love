# 3. The Convergence of Domination and Barbarism: Power as the Root of Hatred, Alienation, and Obstacles to Civilizational Development

This section aims to explore in depth the thesis that “domination is the social root of hatred and barbarism.” We will examine the fundamental link between hierarchical power structures and destructive human behavior as well as social stagnation. The analysis will systematically address how various forms of political, economic, social, and cultural power generate hatred, strip and instrumentalize love in human relationships, and ultimately obstruct genuine civilizational progress. Drawing on critical social theory, Marxist analysis, Foucauldian perspectives, and contemporary psychology and sociology, we will reveal how domination, beneath the veneer of modern progress, perpetuates—and even deepens—a condition of “primordial barbarism.”

Yes, this also means that human society still exists in a half-barbaric, half-civilized state.

## 3.1 Hatred, Barbaric Behavior, and Domination

According to Wikipedia, hatred is a strong negative emotional reaction toward certain people, things, or ideas, often linked to opposition or disgust. Hatred is frequently associated with intense anger, contempt, and revulsion, and is sometimes regarded as the opposite of love.

Hatred is a latent, object-directed negative emotional experience that can be externalized as aggression, insults, deception, contempt, or discrimination against others (or oneself), or internalized as anger, sadness, despair, disappointment, or loathing.

It is both an inner emotional state and a process whereby individuals or collective organizations incite and translate this emotion into violent thoughts and actions. Rooted in zero-sum “life-or-death” dualism, hatred manifests in verbal assault, institutionalized discrimination, social exclusion, and violent practices. These not only erode trust and public cooperation, jeopardizing the physical and psychological well-being of others, but also backfire on perpetrators, leading to self-barbarization and cycles of inner torment.

The origins of hatred are evolutionarily intelligible: lions need prey, boar piglets need protection. In the jungle, facing food scarcity or predators, there is no space for love—only extreme hatred ensures survival. For humans, responding to barbaric assault often necessitates barbaric retaliation to defend oneself or others—what we term legitimate self-defense. Indeed, hatred can sometimes serve crucial self-protective or altruistic functions. However, since legitimate self-defense entails a complex blend of love and hate, it will not be the focus here.

Triggers of Hatred:

- Negative judgments and emotional projection

- Cognitive distortions (e.g., labor alienation)

- Power struggles and domination mechanisms

- Survival threats or selfish motives

Externalization of Hatred:

- Verbal aggression, insult, and discrimination

- Institutional injustice and social exclusion

- Violence and barbaric practices

- Information manipulation and propagandistic incitement

Social Consequences:

- Erosion of social trust and public cooperation

- Reinforcement of “us–them” antagonisms, ritualizing collective hatred

- Intensification of structural inequality and cycles of conflict

Self-Impact:

- Self-barbarization: loss of empathy, magnified violent impulses, pride in being “powerful” or “ruthless”

- Self-torment: cycles of anxiety, guilt, or narcissism, oscillating between “I am unworthy of love” and “everyone must love me”

Among children and adolescents, school bullying, exclusion, or chronic stress often translate suppressed hatred into depression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges—typical expressions of these mechanisms among vulnerable groups.

Hatred can be fleeting or enduring. Its intensity ranges from mild dislike (“I hate broccoli”) to global nihilism (“I hate the entire world”). In some cases, hatred is a learned response shaped by abuse, manipulation, or indoctrination.

If we define barbaric behavior as any deliberate act that inflicts harm, oppression, or deprivation upon one’s own or others’ life, dignity, freedom, ecology, or spirit—then we see clearly that such intentional harm requires the presence of deep negative emotions toward its target. Except in cases of specific mental illness, hatred—manifesting as loathing, fear, prejudice, discrimination, deceit, or envy—provides the core psychological fuel for barbarism. Its ultimate effect is to damage, or even sever, the bonds of love and trust between human beings and between humans and nature.

In this sense, hatred supplies the emotional justification (“they deserve punishment”), while barbaric behavior supplies the practical means (exclusion, online mobbing, torture, massacre, discriminatory laws).

Thus, hatred is the central psychological driver of barbaric action. In other words, behaviors motivated by hatred are inherently barbaric rather than civilized.

Since we have already defined acts of love as Love Languages, we now introduce the counterpart: acts of hatred and barbarism as Hate Languages. For brevity, we also use “hate” to refer to this category.

Hate is a negative emotional experience constructed through human cognition and practice, often externalized into harmful behaviors.

In this paper, we focus specifically on hate languages expressed through hateful and barbaric acts.

Domination refers to the exercise of control by a minority or an individual, through power structures, over the life, will, property, and autonomy of others. It directly violates others’ “freedom” and “dignity,” and entails oppression and exploitation of the majority. It is, therefore, itself a form of barbarism. Prejudice, discrimination, hatred, fear, and the thirst for power are often legitimized and institutionalized within relations of domination. Where domination becomes normalized, other barbarisms—torture, enslavement, systemic oppression—follow as its subordinate forms.

“The essence of politics is power, not morality.” So warned Niccolò Machiavelli in The Prince. Similarly, over 1,800 years earlier, Shang Yang in The Book of Lord Shang offered parallel insights. If domination is not rooted in morality, then its essence is—as Lu Xun wrote in Diary of a Madman—to eat people.

Domination permeates all realms of human society: from states to families, from politics to economics, from corporations to schools. Its ubiquity multiplies its harms. If domination invariably produces barbarism, then hatred is its underlying driver—this is no exaggeration.

As the U.S. Declaration of Independence (1776) proclaimed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” Yet 248 years later, one need only examine the actions of the Trump administration to ask: which of these inalienable rights were truly safeguarded under its rule?

Of course, this indictment applies not only to Trump but to rulers in general.

Structures of Power in Contemporary Human Domination

Political Power Structures:

- International organizations (UN, WTO, IEA, WHO, UNESCO) shaping sovereignty, trade, energy, health, culture, and education.

- Nation-states and government branches (legislative, executive, judicial).

- Military and police (monopoly on legitimate violence).

- Bureaucracies (vast civil service systems).

Economic Power Structures:

- Capital (Marx’s “silent force”).

- Multinational corporations and monopolistic conglomerates.

- Financial institutions (banks, private equity, hedge funds).

Cultural and Ideological Power Structures:

- Mainstream media and opinion-shaping machinery.

- Educational systems (curricula, classrooms, examinations).

- Religion and ideological organizations.

Technological and Informational Power Structures:

- Tech giants and platforms (algorithmic recommendation, data control).

- Surveillance and security networks (digital monitoring, big-data analysis).

Social and Group Power Structures:

- Elite networks and exclusive clubs.

- Families and kinship systems (mutual aid and exclusion based on bloodline or locality).

- Professional and industry associations (certifications, standards, regulations).

Familial and Intimate Power Structures:

- Household authority hierarchies: parental control over children or spousal domination based on tradition, economics, or emotional dependency.

- Patriarchal/clan systems legitimizing absolute seniority.

- Invisible domination in intimate relationships (emotional blackmail, financial control, information blocking).

Legal and Institutional Power Structures:

- Legal texts and judicial interpretations (defining “legal/illegal”).

- Regulatory and compliance systems (licensing, censorship, sanctions).

These structures intersect to form a multi-dimensional domination network linking ruling elites, privileged classes, and vested interests into an entrenched alliance. Thus, any discussion of human governance must necessarily address domination and power in depth.
