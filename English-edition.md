# Abstract

# 1. Love, Hate, Civilization and Barbarism

## 1.1 Love
Although love existed widely in the animal kingdom long before the emergence of humankind, its understanding and expression in philosophy, religion, and diverse cultures have always shown significant differences. This divergence is largely due to the destruction caused by rulers—the guardians and mass-producers of hatred—as well as to humanity’s ongoing process of developing and enriching love itself.

Through our research, we believe that love can now be unified under the following description:

Love is a positive emotional experience and virtuous behavioral pattern, collectively constructed through public cooperation and collective wisdom, by which human beings secure peace and healthy development for themselves, improve interpersonal relations, and advance overall social progress.

Love is an advanced management mechanism crafted by human wisdom—it serves both as the “safety valve” between energy and emotion, and as the “compass” between words, deeds, and relationships. Its purpose is to ensure individual growth in peace and health, optimize human interactions, and promote harmony, stability, and sustainable development in society.

Most importantly, if hatred is the devil in everyone’s heart, then love is the angel within. Love is the supreme regulatory wisdom against hate.

- Emotional Dimension: Love is a deeper, stronger, and longer-lasting positive experience than mere “liking.” It is the most fundamental emotional need of humanity. Love generates profound care and devotion toward others or all beings. It is not simply an amplification of affection but an experience that gives both body and soul fulfillment and meaning.

- Behavioral Dimension: Love manifests in concrete, virtuous actions—what we call civilized behavior. Through care, respect, understanding, support, and other positive deeds, it seeks to enhance the well-being and harmonious development of self, others, and society at large.

- Source of Wisdom: Love originates from wisdom—it is the consensus interface, connective mechanism, and management logic produced during the evolution of intelligence. It enables living beings to allocate resources reasonably, coordinate relationships, and secure safety and happiness in complex environments.

- Trinity of Mind: Love is the unity of wisdom, emotion, and behavior.

- Essence of Life: Love arises from a profound self-understanding of life itself. It is the inevitable choice of both individuals and groups in the pursuit of self-knowledge and self-realization.

- Code of Cooperation: Love possesses a public and transformative power, capable of driving change and activating solidarity. In the interactions between humans and AI, AI and AI, humans and nature, and humans and the future, love will become the most stable and efficient protocol for co-creation and collaboration. It will make technology no longer cold but warm, and make civilization no longer fragmented but harmonious.

- Traceable yet Individualized: We have summarized eleven common “love languages” used by people. Yet we know none of them are universally effective. For example, some may feel little from verbal gratitude—because love is essentially a pleasurable emotional experience. Without such joy, claiming to have “received love” is hollow.

- Light of the Universe: Love is the driving force of civilization, the warmth of technology, and the symphony the universe writes in the name of self-knowledge, where life and intelligence dance together.

This is the full meaning of love.

In this description, we no longer emphasize words such as “duty,” “obligation,” or “loyalty,” which are often tied to the labor-based value system. To us, love is as essential as eating and drinking—it should never be forcibly tied to the ruling ethics of obligation.

As Hanno Sauer writes in the preface to *The Invention of Good and Evil* (Die Erfindung von Gut und Böse):

“How should we locate ourselves? How do we want to live? How should we relate to each other? … These are moral questions, and what I aim to tell is a history of morality. Morality sounds like repression and coercion, like restriction and sacrifice, like the Inquisition, confession, and uneasy conscience, like chastity and catechism—joyless, conservative, closed, shaking its finger in prohibition at everything.”

This awakens us: from Aristotle to Kant, from Confucius to Nietzsche, ethics has always attempted to answer the fundamental question: “How should one live?” Although in the gestures of early humans sharing berries by the campfire we can already find the most genuine ethical answers, throughout the long history of labor civilizations, ruling elites often molded morality into a tool to preserve hierarchy and enforce obedience. Morality came to mean repression, confinement, and sacrifice—equated with inquisitorial judgment, self-torment in confession, the shackles of chastity, and countless rules of prohibition. This system of morality ensured social stability at the cost of individual freedom and uniqueness.

For example, agrarian civilizations cast this contract into chains of hierarchy with bronze ploughshares. When the Code of Hammurabi inscribed “an eye for an eye” onto clay tablets, when Confucian ritual ethics elevated “restraining one’s desires and returning to propriety” into a moral imperative, humans unknowingly transformed ethics into an instrument of control. As Foucault reveals in Discipline and Punish, morality evolved into invisible chains disciplining the body, while the Dalit “purity rules” of the Indian caste system carried this alienation to absurd extremes.

Yet if we return to the origin of ethics, its core concerns remain unchanged:

- “How should one live?”

- “What gives life meaning?”

- “How should we relate to each other?”

- “Where do our values truly arise?”

In labor-dominated societies, these questions were framed under “productivity first,” with answers such as: “Work hard, obey order, follow rules.” However, once labor is no longer necessary for survival, these answers fundamentally shift—

We exist not because we are useful, but because we are loved.

Thus, to restore ethics to its true source, only love—that which brings positive emotional experience and civilized behavior—can be humanity’s genuine core ethic.

In short: Love is each individual’s wisdom of self-management in emotion and behavior, humanity’s social management wisdom, and the core ethic of human civilization.
